# Simulated Annealing Algorithm for Pathfinding in Game Environment

This repository contains a simple game environment designed for testing the Simulated Annealing algorithm.

## Game Environment Description:
- The matrix represents a game board where each cell has specific characteristics.
- '0' represents a free path.
- '1' represents an obstacle.
- '2' represents a reward that multiplies points by 2.
- '4' represents the finish line.
- I assume that game environment (2D matrix) must be a square.

## Goal of the Algorithm:
The objective of the Simulated Annealing algorithm is to find the shortest path to the finish line while maximizing rewards within the given game environment.
